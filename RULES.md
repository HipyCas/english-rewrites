# Rewrite rules

Programming a working syntax and phrase structure checker is not easy. Due to that, the program is **extremely picky** about what is right and what is not. Here are collected those rules, which try to be as flexible as possible, read them before using the page:

- Use _have_ for causative phrases instead of _get_

- Ensure that you are getting the commas (`,`) right in relative phrases

- Extra spaces will make the phrase go wrong, ensure that you don't add more than one between word and none at the end or the beginning. **Remember that a space is already put after the starting piece of the sentence**

## Flexibilities

Below are listed a couple of rules that the checker ignores:

- All capital letters are ignored, the checker is case-insensitive

- Capital _I_ is ignored too.
