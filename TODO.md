# TODO

- Expand user input contractions and check against non contracted text

- Accept get/have variations for causative

- Regex search/filter

- Add filter by source: exam, teacher or selectividad.

- Add [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti/v/1.0.0) for confetti when you guess the rewrite. Maybe add a simple checkbox toggle for it.

- Make error searcher function be comma insensitive as actual checker.
